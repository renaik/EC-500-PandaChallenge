# Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) Challenge

As a part of our EC500 Medical Imaging with AI course, we attempt to solve the task outlined in the [Prostate CANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/overview). The goal of the challenge is to develop a model to quantitatively estimate the severity of prostate cancer (PCa) based on prostate tissue biopsies.

## Usage


## Data
Details of the dataset used for the PANDA challenge can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment/data).

## Model Architecture
Zheng et al have developed a repository containing a pytorch implementation of deep learning based graph transformer (GT) for whole slide image (WSI) classification that can be found [here](https://github.com/vkola-lab/tmi2022/blob/main/README.md). Details of the implementation can be found in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9779215).
